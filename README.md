# Platformer tutorial project

Very rough side-scrolling platform game I'm using as a workshop for children.

# TODO:

- [ ] Consider a licence
- [x] Add proper object collisions
- [x] Fix return from collision (now returns an impulse away)
- [ ] Add sprite-based collision
    - [ ] Calculate the correct line using a tangent on the spite
    - [ ] Test with a coin
    - [ ] Test with a slope
- [ ] Move *.map files
- [ ] Clean up movement (e.g. wall climbing...) - by adjusting corner tangents?


1. Dragging turns off player velocity
2. Fix redraw from where player was
3. When mouse is clicked - draw bounding boxes and tangents
