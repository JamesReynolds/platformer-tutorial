# Platformer tutorial project

Very rough side-scrolling platform game I'm using as a workshop for children.

# TODO:

- [ ] Consider a licence
- [ ] Make game.ts the initial point of understanding
  - [ ] Encapsulate all mechanics in the player class
  - [x] Create a background class
- [ ] Get working using WebPack
- [ ] Add actual images to the image folder
- [ ] Create a background using an image instead of using a background class
- [ ] Pack using webpack

## Lesson 0
