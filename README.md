# Platformer tutorial project

Very rough side-scrolling platform game I'm using as a workshop for children.

# TODO:

- [ ] Consider a licence
- [ ] Make game.ts the initial point of understanding
  - [ ] Encapsulate all mechanics in the player class
  - [x] Create a background class

## Lesson 0

Syntax & how it works
Draw a new background

## Lesson 1

Bumping into edges?
